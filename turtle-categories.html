                  Leatherback turtles, scientifically known as <em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>, are a remarkable species of sea
                  turtles that possess several unique characteristics. They are renowned for their enormous size, with individuals
                  reaching lengths of up to 6 to 7 feet and weighing between 550 and 2,000 pounds. What sets them apart from other
                  turtles is their distinctive shell, which is not composed of hard, bony scutes like their counterparts but rather
                  consists of a layer of leathery skin with longitudinal ridges.
